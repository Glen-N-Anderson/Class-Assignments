This project uses Google's Speech to Text API with Chatterbot API to demonstrate an application of a voice to text program that can learn
objects and give the user practice math problems. This could be applied as a toy to interact somewhat intelligently with users as well as
give them math problems to solve should they want to practice. While this program is limited in its use, it could be expanded and
integrated with a more practical platform like Android or iOS to create a smart toy.
